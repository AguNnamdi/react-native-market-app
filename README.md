# Farmers Market App

I'm building a React Native app that helps users locate farmer's markets around Sydney. The app aims to encourage users to buy more sustainable produce and support local farmers. It's still a work in progress...

## Features
- IOS & Android friendly
- User data stored in Firebase 
- Google maps geolocation
